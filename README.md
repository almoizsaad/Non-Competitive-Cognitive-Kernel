# NCCK - Non-Competitive Cognitive Kernel

This project implements the core components of the NCCK model proposed by Almoiz Saad Yousuf Mohamed. It simulates a non-competitive ethical AI reasoning engine inspired by biological systems such as elephants and cooperative species.

## Features

- Ethical evaluation of AI decisions based on intent and impact.
- Detection of dominance-driven or exploitative goals.
- Experimental simulation with test cases and analysis.

## Files

- `ncck_engine.py` Main ethical evaluation logic.
- `generate_cases.py` Prepares test input scenarios.
- `run_simulation.py` Executes the assessment and saves results.
- `analyze_results.py` Generates a visual summary.
- `test_cases.json` Example input dataset.

## Usage

```bash
python generate_cases.py
python run_simulation.py
python analyze_results.py
