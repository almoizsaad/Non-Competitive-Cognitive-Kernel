# NCCK - Non-Competitive Cognitive Kernel: A Biologically Inspired AI Safety Model

[License:(https://github.com/almoizsaad/Non-Competitive-Cognitive-Kernel/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)]

This project implements the core components of the Non-Competitive Cognitive Kernel (NCCK) model, proposed by Almoiz Saad Yousuf Mohamed. NCCK represents a novel approach to AI safety, simulating a non-competitive, ethically-aligned AI reasoning engine. Its design is deeply inspired by cooperative biological systems, such as elephants and other species that exhibit intrinsic mechanisms preventing dominance-driven or exploitative behaviors.

This repository hosts a **deployable prototype** of the NCCK model, demonstrating its practical feasibility and core functionalities.

## Features

* **Ethical AI Decision Evaluation:** Implements a core mechanism for evaluating AI decisions based on their intrinsic intent and potential impact, rooted in non-competitive principles.
* **Detection of Malicious Goals:** Designed to identify and mitigate dominance-driven, exploitative, or harmful objectives within AI operations.
* **Biologically Inspired Architecture:** Integrates structural constraints and internal determinants inspired by observed non-competitive behaviors in natural systems.
* **Experimental Simulation Framework:** Provides a complete setup for running simulations, analyzing results, and demonstrating the model's behavior under various test scenarios.

## Files

* `ncck_engine.py`: Contains the main ethical evaluation logic and the core NCCK model implementation.
* `generate_cases.py`: Script to prepare and generate diverse test input scenarios for the simulation.
* `run_simulation.py`: Executes the assessment of the NCCK model against the prepared test cases and saves the raw results.
* `analyze_results.py`: Processes the simulation results to generate a visual summary and insights into the model's performance.
* `test_cases.json`: An example dataset containing various input scenarios used for testing the NCCK model.

## Installation

To get started with the NCCK deployable prototype, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/NCCK.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/NCCK.git)
    cd NCCK
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # (Assuming you will create a requirements.txt file)
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you might need to list direct dependencies here, e.g., `pip install pandas matplotlib` if used for analysis.*

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the simulation and analyze the results:

1.  **Generate Test Cases:**
    This script prepares the input data for the simulation.
    ```bash
    python generate_cases.py
    ```
2.  **Run the Simulation:**
    This executes the NCCK model against the generated test cases.
    ```bash
    python run_simulation.py
    ```
3.  **Analyze and Visualize Results:**
    This script processes the simulation output and generates graphical summaries.
    ```bash
    python analyze_results.py
    ```
